# Beeline

## Game Description

**Beeline** is an engaging strategy game where you play as the queen bee, managing your hive to ensure it has enough honey for the coming winter. The queen bee relies on her scout and worker bees to gather information about flower locations and collect pollen. The game is played on a rectangular field with various symbols representing different elements of the environment.

## Gameplay

In **Beeline**, your goal is to maximize the honey production of your hive by efficiently managing your bees. Here are the key elements of the game:

### Field Layout

The game field is a rectangle containing the following symbols:

- **H**: Hive - The home base for your bees.
- **Letters (A, B, C, etc.)**: Different types of flowers that contain pollen.
- **U**: Used flowers - Flowers that have already been harvested.
- **P**: Pitcher plants - Dangerous plants that trap bees.
- **Space**: Empty spots in the field.

### Bees

There are two types of bees:

1. **Scout Bees**: These bees are responsible for flying to specified locations in the field and reporting back the locations of flowers.
2. **Worker Bees**: These bees fly to specified locations, harvest pollen from flowers, and report back the locations of flowers.

### Rules

- Each bee can only be given a single task before it retires to the hive to make honey.
- A flower can only be harvested for pollen once.
- If a bee encounters a pitcher plant, it will be trapped and unable to return to the hive.

### Example Field

Below is an example of what the field might look like as the game progresses:

```bash
                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                0| | | | | | | |L|G|L|
                1| | | | | | | |G|C|G|
                2| |B| | | | | | |G| |
                3| | | | | | | | | | |
                4| | | | | | | | | | |
                5| | | | |H| | | | | |
                6| | | | | | | | | | |
                7| | | | | | | | | | |
                8| |U|U| | | | | | | |
                9| |U|U| | | | | | | |
```


## Objectives

1. **Manage Your Bees**: Assign tasks to scout and worker bees efficiently.
2. **Maximize Honey Production**: Ensure that flowers are harvested for pollen without losing too many bees to pitcher plants.
3. **Strategize**: Make the best use of the information provided by scout bees to direct worker bees to the most lucrative flower locations.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Start with an initial field layout with the hive, flowers, pitcher plants, and empty spaces.
2. **Assign Tasks**: Send out scout bees to explore the field and gather information on flower locations.
3. **Harvest Pollen**: Direct worker bees to the flowers to collect pollen and return to the hive.
4. **Avoid Dangers**: Keep your bees safe from pitcher plants by planning their paths carefully.
5. **Collect Honey**: Accumulate honey by successfully harvesting pollen from flowers and returning to the hive.

## Winning the Game

You win the game by ensuring that your hive has enough honey to survive the winter. Effective management and strategic planning are key to achieving this goal.
